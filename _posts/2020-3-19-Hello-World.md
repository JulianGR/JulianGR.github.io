This is it, I'm officially a blogger. **I am sick of not being blogger**. I happen to spend some of my time in the weekends reading other's blogs (promise to write a future post about my inspirations) and I couldn't be more delighted by some of the authentic jewels you find (if you are going to click only in one link in this blog, let it be this one: [cirosantilli.com](https://cirosantilli.com/)). I've been wanting to open a blog for a while and now I finally made it.

-   My name is Julián (Jules for friends). Apart from being my name, it's a [town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian,_California) in US. Alternatively you can have a laugh at the [Urban Dictionary page](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Julian).
-   I'm from Spain (thus the accent in the **á**), specifically from a beautiful city in the south, Sevilla.
-   I'm studying third year of Computer Science.
-   You can look at a picture of me in the [About page](https://juliangr.github.io/about/).

##### Why this blog?

My main interest when writing this blog is to share my vision about the things I like to the world. That being said, I don't have any particular aim for the future: I just do it because I like it. I honestly don't care about "number of clicks" or "audience retention", and that's why you will never see an ad.

The content will go from **technical to shower thoughts**. I love teaching so I will post **guides and tutorials** from time to time.

I have multiples ways of contact ([About page](https://juliangr.github.io/about/)) and you, my dear reader, can also comment below - don't be afraid of doing so!

###### _Peace, Julián._
